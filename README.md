# GPR Stock Prediction
In this module I use Gaussian Process Regression to Predict Open and Close Stock Prices for Apple, Tesla, Google, SalesForce, Twitter and Microsoft. I was able to use data sets from `yfinance` and I constructed my GPR models using `sklearn` and `gpytorch`.  

## Installation
to use this module you will need to install packages found in `requirements.txt`:
